This page summarizes the hardware architecture and gives help for [HDL simulation](#simulate-hdl-sources), [FPGA compilation](#compile-for-fpga) and [target programmation](#synthetize-place-route-and-program-device).

## Hardware architecture

As illustrated in figure below, the `top.vhd` architecture contains the PTRNG including the [digital noise source](#digital-noise-source) (more information on [its configuration](#digital-noise-configuration)).

![Top architecture](/assets/images/top.png)

A communication chain is enabled from the PC to the PTRNG with the help of an UART, and a simple interpreter for read/write commands that performs transactions on the [register map](#register-map-configuration).

The register map is required to:
- send control and configurations to the PTRNG,
- read statuses from the PTRNG,
- read random data generated by the PTRNG in the FIFO.

### Digital noise source

The digital noise source is mainly composed of a bank of 2 [ring-oscillators](#ring-oscillators) a least and a [digitizer](#digital-noise-source) block responsible to sample the relative phase noise of the oscillators.

#### Ring-oscillators

The generic ring-oscillators are described in `ring.vhd` located in the directory `hardware/target/common/generic`. They are based on loop of inverters and a NAND gate to allow the oscillation to be enabled and disabled.

![Generic ring-oscillator](/assets/images/ringoscillator.png)

On FPGA ring-oscillators a made of Lookup-tables (LUT): one `LUT2` for the NAND, several `LUT1` for the inverters (or buffers).

It is crucial to give the synthesis tool specific constraints to allow combinatorial loops. The place and route tool also need physical constraints in order to guarantee the quality of the signal (mainly to limit crosstalks from other parts of the design through the cells or nets).

As illustrated in the following floorplan picture:
- ring-oscillators are isolated from each other in the bank,
- the digitizer block, that responsible of clock-domain-crossing (RO to system clock), is close to the rings,
- the ditital noise block is isolated by a forbidden area all around.

![Digital noise place and route](/assets/images/floorplan.png)

All the constraints are given in the file `constraints.xdc` located in `hardware/config/digitalnoise`. This file is generated by a script, detailed in the [digital noise configuration](#digital-noise-configuration) section.

#### Digitizer

The digitizer comes with the following sampling architectures: [ERO](#ero), [MURO](#muro) and [COSO](#coso).

##### ERO

The _Elementary Ring-Oscillator_ (ERO) TRNG is the simpliest sampling architecture. It instanciates two ring-oscillators:
- `RO0` frequency is divided by factor K in order to accumulate jitter (i.e. phase noise),
- `RO1` that is sampled by the previously divided ring-oscillator.

![ERO sampling architecture](/assets/images/ero.png)

This architecture benefits from a simple design, however the division factor required to accumulated enough noise makes the output bitrate very slow. As instance with a 100MHz ring-oscillator and a division factor of K=1000, the output rate is limited to 100kbit/s.

##### MURO

The _MUlti Ring-Oscillator_ (MURO) TRNG is designed to improve the entropy rate by accumulating noise from several ring-oscillators that are XORed and the sampled with the same principle as for ERO.

![MURO sampling architecture](/assets/images/muro.png)

With lower accumulation time, the MURO benefits from higher throughput. However, instanciating multiple ring-oscillators increase the risk of locking phenomenon that would cancel all captured noise.

##### COSO

The _COherent Sampling Oscillator_ (COSO) TRNG samples directly `RO1` with `RO0`. The sampled output is called the `beat` signal and is the image of the accumulated jitter between the two oscillators. The `beat` signal period is measured with a counter that is incremented in steps of `RO0`. In other words, this counter measures the accumulation of the phase noise. The less significant bit (LSB) of the counter final value is taken as output for the random bit.

![COSO sampling architecture](/assets/images/coso.png)

The COSO architecture benefits from small footprint, a relevant output rate and has an intrinsic failure alarm. However, the COSO needs the frequencies ratio to be controlled.

### Dependencies

OpenTRNG projects depends on the following submodules:

| GitHub | Descrition |
| :----- | :--------- |
| [vhdl-extras](https://github.com/kevinpt/vhdl-extras) | Provides a set of standard and common VHDL entities. |
| [fluart](https://github.com/marcj71/fluart) | The feature-less UART to provide communication between PC and target. |
| [cmd_proc](https://github.com/marcj71/cmd_proc) | handle simple read-write adress/data packet processing on the UART. |

We also use the [Corsair](https://github.com/esynr3z/corsair) tool to generate the register map (see [this section](#register-map-configuration)).

## Simulate HDL sources

Testbenches for simulating HDL sources are scripted using [cocotb](https://www.cocotb.org) in Python, and are located in the `hardware/sim` directory. Each testbench comprises multiple test cases. The python [ring-oscillator emulator](emulator#emulate-noisy-ring-oscillators) is used to generate noisy clock signals for the testcases.

For example, to run the simulation of the COSO testbench, use the following commands:

```
$ cd hardware/sim/test_coso
$ make
```

The summary of the testbench simulation is displayed in the terminal:

```
********************************************************************************************

```

Thanks to `ghdl` simulator, all testbenches record their waveforms in the `waves.vcd` file. Waveform files can be visualized using tools like [GTKWave](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave) or [Wavedrom](https://wavedrom.com), for example.

## Compile for FPGA

The VHDL provided in the `hardware/hdl` directory is target agnostic, it can be synthetized for all FPGA vendors (even ASIC). On the contrary, ring-oscillator implementations are specific to the target. As instance, the directory `target/common/xilinx` provides a `ring.vhd` dedicated implementation for Xilinx FPGAs.

### FPGA targets

As of now OpenTRNG supports the [Digilent Arty A7 35T](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/start) board, based on [Xilinx Artix-7](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/artix-7.html) FPGA.

![image-center](/assets/images/arty7.png)

Please follow these instructions to add the support for a new Xilinx target:

- create a new directory in `hardware/target/fpga` and jump into,
- then create a `target.vhd` for the global _top_ for the target,
- create a `target.xdc` to specify the physical constraints (such as pinout, clocking, IO settings...),
- then call the script `generate_vivado_project.tcl` as explained in the next section to create the Vivado project.

### Synthetize, place route and program device

Scaffold script `generate_vivado_project.tcl` is provided to generate Xilinx Vivado projects for any targets, the `tcl` script is located here `hardware/target/fpga`. Use the following command to generate the Vivado project `opentrng_arty_a7_35t.xpr` in the directory `arty_a7_35t` for the target `xc7a35ticsg324-1L`:

```
$ cd hardware/target/fpga
$ vivado -mode tcl -source generate_vivado_project.tcl -tclargs arty_a7_35t xc7a35ticsg324-1L
```

The start Vivado with the command:

```
$ vivado -mode gui arty_a7_35t/opentrng_arty_a7_35t.xpr
```

After runing Vivado's _Synthesis_, _Implementation_ and _Bitstream generation_ you will be able to program your target with the help of the _Hardware Manager_.

### Design configurations

Some part of the design is generated with scripts (eg. [register map](#register-map-configuration)) or configured with script (such as for [digital noise](#digital-noise-configuration)).

#### Register map configuration

The PTRNG block exposes several configuration, status and data registers as ports of the entity. These registers are wrapped into a register map, that allows to access the registers from the PC with simple read and write operations. All the code (target side and PC side) is generated with [Corsair](https://github.com/esynr3z/corsair), taking as input the `registers.yml` configuration file located in `hardware/config/registers`.

The register map specification is available [here in the PTRNG repository](https://github.com/opentrng/ptrng/blob/master/hardware/config/registers/regmap.md).

#### Digital noise configuration

The `digitalnoise` entity described in the file `digitalnoise.vhd` necessitate to be configured. On the supported targets, this entity comes with a default configuration.

The configuration consists in generating:
- the `settings.vhd` VHDL packages which describes the size and the number of ring-oscillators and also defines the type of sampling architecture,
- the `constraints.xdc` (for Xilinx) that describes the physical constraints for ring-oscillator place and route.

The script `generate.py` is located in `hardware/config/digitalnoise`, and is usable with these parameters:

```
$ python ./generate.py -h
usage: generate.py [-h] -vendor {xilinx} -luts LUTS [-fixedlutpin FIXEDLUTPIN] -x X -y Y -maxwidth MAXWIDTH -maxheight MAXHEIGHT -border BORDER -ringwidth RINGWIDTH -digitheight DIGITHEIGHT -digittype {TEST,COSO} -hpad HPAD -vpad VPAD -fmax FMAX -len
                   LEN [LEN ...]

Generate configuration files for the digitalnoise entity. More specifically it generates: 'settings.vhd' that contains HDL constants and 'placeroute.*' that contains all timing/place/route constraints for digitalnoise (extension depending on vendor).

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -vendor {xilinx}      target vendor (for selecting the templates)
  -luts LUTS            number of LUT per item (per slice for Xilinx, per LE for Intel Altera)
  -fixedlutpin FIXEDLUTPIN
                        optional parameter to fix the input pin for all LUTs (the value is the name of the pin)
  -x X                  origin abscissa for the reserved area
  -y Y                  origin ordinate for the reserved area
  -maxwidth MAXWIDTH    maximum width for the reserved area
  -maxheight MAXHEIGHT  maximum height for the reserved area
  -border BORDER        forbidden border all around inside the reserved area
  -ringwidth RINGWIDTH  column width for a ring-oscillator
  -digitheight DIGITHEIGHT
                        height for the digitizer block
  -digittype {TEST,COSO}
                        choice of the sampling architecture for the digitizer
  -hpad HPAD            horizontal padding between ROs
  -vpad VPAD            vertical padding between ROs
  -fmax FMAX            maximum estimated frequency for all ring-oscillators (Hz)
  -len LEN [LEN ...]    number of elements in each ring-oscillator
```

The default configuration for the _Digilent Arty7_ board is generated with:

```
$ python generate.py -vendor xilinx -luts 4 -x 12 -y 102 -maxwidth 15 -maxheight 22 -border 2 -digittype COSO -digitheight 8 -ringwidth 2 -hpad 2 -vpad 2 -fmax 220e6 -len 20 21
```

This project is dedicated to delivering the community open-source implementations of reference Physical True Random Number Generator (TRNG or PTRNG) based on ring oscillators. Through OpenTRNG, you have the ability to:\n Emulate noisy ring oscillators Emulate raw random number Simulate, compile and run the PTRNG on FPGA Analyze and evaluate their outcomes  OpenTRNG is fully compatible with OpenTitan, our PTRNG can be used as input for OpenTitan\u0026rsquo;s hardware IP blocks. Please find more information in the hardware section.\nThe OpenTRNG project will be released soon! Please stay tuned.  Why OpenTRNG? #  The objective of OpenTRNG is to offer reference architectures of ring-oscillator based True Random Number Generators (TRNG), also known as PTRNG, to the community. With the advancement of certification standards like BSI AIS20/31 (used in the Common Criteria) and NIST SP 800-90B, the stochastic model of the entropy source is increasingly crucial in relation to validating statistical tests on output data. Here, we publish straightforward yet effective entropy sources for PTRNG to facilitate the validation of their stochastic models across various FPGA and ASIC targets.\nIn RO-based True Random Number Generators (TRNGs), the RO serves as the entropy source. Specifically, the inherent jitter between two (or more) ROs generates relative phase noise, which is known random, uncontrollable, and unpredictable. This relative phase noise is then converted into random bits through a sampling mechanism.\nAs of now, OpenTRNG includes the following reference sampling architectures:\n Elementary based Ring Oscilator (ERO), Multi Ring Oscilator (MURO), Coherent Sampling Ring Oscilator (COSO).

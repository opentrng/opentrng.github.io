## Introduction

Welcome to **OpenTRNG**, the open-source framework for True Random Number Generators! ðŸŽ²

This project provides the community with **reference implementations of Physical TRNGs** (PTRNGs) based on ring oscillators, designed to be transparent, reproducible, and easy to experiment with.

With **OpenTRNG**, you can:

1. [Emulate noisy ring oscillators](docs/emulator#emulate-noisy-ring-oscillators)
2. [Emulate raw random number](docs/emulator#emulate-raw-random-numbers)
3. [Simulate](docs/hardware#simulate-hdl-sources), [compile](docs/hardware#compile-for-fpga) and [run](docs/remote) the PTRNG on hardware
4. [Analyze and evaluate the random outcomes](docs/analysis#analyze-and-evaluate-outputs)

<!-- > **OpenTRNG** is fully compatible with [OpenTitan](https://opentitan.org), our PTRNG can be used as input for OpenTitan's hardware IP blocks. Please find more information in the hardware section.

## Why OpenTRNG?

The objective of **OpenTRNG**, the open-source TRNG, is to offer reference architectures of ring-oscillator based True Random Number Generators (TRNG), also known as PTRNG, to the community. With the advancement of **certification standards** like [BSI AIS20/31](https://www.bsi.bund.de/dok/randomnumbergenerators) (used in the Common Criteria) and [NIST SP 800-90B](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/90/b/final), the **stochastic model** of the entropy source is increasingly crucial in relation to validating statistical tests on output data. Here, we publish straightforward yet effective entropy sources for PTRNG to facilitate the validation of their stochastic models across various FPGA and ASIC targets.

In RO-based True Random Number Generators (TRNGs), the RO serves as the **entropy source**. Specifically, the inherent **jitter** between two (or more) ROs generates relative **phase noise**, which is known random, uncontrollable, and unpredictable. This relative phase noise is then converted into **random bits** through a sampling mechanism.

As of now, **OpenTRNG** includes the following reference sampling architectures:

* Elementary based Ring Oscilator ([ERO](docs/hardware#ero)),
* Multi Ring Oscilator ([MURO](docs/hardware#muro)),
* Coherent Sampling Ring Oscilator ([COSO](docs/hardware#coso)).

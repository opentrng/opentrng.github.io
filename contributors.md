Licinius BENEA received the B.Eng. in Materials Science from INSA Lyon and his M.Eng. in Nanotechnology from Ecole Centrale - Universit√© Claude Bernard - INSA Lyon in 2015. His PhD degree, focused on the electrical characterization and simulation of SOI devices for biochemical applications, was obtained from Grenoble Alpes University in 2019. Since then, he has been with CEA-Leti working on security primitives, especially TRNGs.

Mikael CARMONA is Engineer (2007) and PhD (2011) in Signal Processing. He obtained the French Agregation of Mathematics in 2007. From 2011-2015, he worked at CEA-Leti on R&D projects on MEMS integration and applications. In 2016, he co-founded the startup MORPHOSENSE as CTO, the company was bought by SERCEL in 2023. He joins the Hardware Security Division of CEA-Leti in 2021 and leads since 2022 the Laboratory of Security of Components, that focuses on innovation related to Hardware IP for security and secure IPs: random numbers generation (TRNG & PUF), cryptography (Classical, Post-quantum, Quantum), RISC-V based processors. Studying the role and the impact of the technology (transistor, substrate, standard cells) in the security features of a component is a main driver of the laboratory.

Florian PEBAY-PEYROULA joined the CEA in 2003 as Engineer. His experience includes very-high-bit-rate contactless communications for smart cards and contributions to the standardization of the technology. He joined the hardware security team in 2011, shifting his focus to embedded systems for automotive, medical, and industrial control applications. Later, he helped develop new concepts for hardware trust modules. His current focus is TRNG architectures for emerging hardware technologies.
